This function makes "junk" CSS (little or no whitespace) somewhat readable by adding newlines after '{', '}', and ';' characters. It also inserts a single space before every '{'.

Example of junk CSS: http://imgs.xkcd.com/s/c40a9f8.css

You can put the function in your .vimrc or save the script in $VIMRUNTIME/scripts
